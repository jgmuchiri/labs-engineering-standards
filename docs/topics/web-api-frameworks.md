# (AA-100) Web API Frameworks

Only the following web API frameworks are approved for projects in Labs:

- REST
- GraphQL

Rationale:

- We restrict the web API frameworks used in Lambda Labs so that we
can focus our resources on a subset of available technologies. By
narrowing the field of choices, product quality will be improved
through the sharing of common knowledge and reusable components.

- These two frameworks cover the vast majority of use cases, enjoy
significant market share, and are not mutually exclusive.

Exceptions:

- None
